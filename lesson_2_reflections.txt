What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the folder for the versions to start syncing. A repository is
useful because it will give me a single place to track all of the file
versions of a particular project. However, I still have a lot to learn
about how to actively use it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is just what it says. It seems to give us an opportunity to
double check what we are planning to commit before we do in between commits.
