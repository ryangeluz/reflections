Lesson 3 Reflections

March 10, 2015

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Hmm. Well I suppose the first obvious answer is that having a backup copy on a remote
database is useful to have in case my computer takes a dive on me. I also think it will
be easier to share with others via the web link, so if I'm looking for feedback on an
open source project, having it up on GitHub is the way to go. Also, another obvious
answer just occurred to me. What happens if I'm using somebody else's computer and don't
have access to my home repository? With a remote repository, I can work virtually from
any computer with internet access.
